<h1>Code Projects</h1>
<p>
Here are some open source software projects I have done for fun.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Nebuloid</strong><br/>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <a href="/img/nebuloid.png" class="thumbnail" target="_blank">
       <img src="/img/nebuloid.png" />
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        Nebuloid is a top down space shooter written in java.  Fly around looking for colored nebulae to change your ship to shoot that color of laser, which is the only way to get through colored barriers.  Destroy the barriers around the mother ship and blow it up to beat the level.
      </p>
      <p>
        This could be a good way to learn about game loops and events to start on a game of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build and run the project by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/pwntato/nebuloid" target="_blank">repo</a> and running the included build.sh file.

  <strong>PointAndPixel</strong>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <a href="/img/pointAndPixel.png" class="thumbnail" target="_blank">
       <img src="/img/pointAndPixel.png" />
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        PointAndPixel is a pixel art program written in java.  You can either work free form or you can import an image to start from.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote this after seeing a friend make pixel art in a spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build and run the project by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/pwntato/PointAndPixel" target="_blank">repo</a> and running the included build_jar.sh file.

  <strong>Picrypt</strong>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <a href="/img/picrypt.png" class="thumbnail" target="_blank">

        Picrypt is a steganography program written in java that embeds highly encrypted files into normal images.  It uses public key encryption so keys can be easily shared between trusted parties.  Then pictures with embedded data can be shared through normal services as long as they serve the raw image instead of a compressed or resized version.

        Build and run the project by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/pwntato/picrypt" target="_blank">repo</a> and running the included build.sh file.
