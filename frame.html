  <h1>Printable Picture Frame</h1>
  <p>For the holidays this year, I decided to take advantage of my 3D printer to help with gifts.  We usually send out family pictures in frames, so this year I decided to 3D print our frames.  This is what we gave out:</p>
</div>
  
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="/img/frame.png" class="thumbnail" target="_blank">
      <img src="/img/frame.png" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <p>Since the holidays have passed, and I wanted to keep this a special token of 2013 for my family, I have modified the design so it can be for anyone or anything you love.  It could be especially good for Valentine's Day.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="/img/frame_cad.png" class="thumbnail" target="_blank">
      <img src="/img/frame_cad.png" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
 
<div class="row"> 
  <p>This is fully customizable.  You could even leverage my <a href="/printable_coin" target="_blank">Custom Coin</a> tutorial to add all sorts of designs, including text.  Since this prints with the frame face up, you can skip the minkowski transformation and it will print just fine.</p>

<p>This is for wallet size pictures and there is a slot in the back to slide the picture in.  I also used two strips of magnetic tape so the frame would stick to a refrigerator or cubical wall.</p>

  <p>To make one for yourself, clone my <a href="https://github.com/pwntato/frame" target="_blank">github repo</a>.  You might want to play with the padding to get it just right for your printer, but it should work pretty easily as is.  The bezel is there both to look nice and provide a good place to pry it off the build platform with a screw driver.  If you run into problems with it not sticking to the bed, try some acetone as suggested in my <a href="/3d_printing_tips" target="_blank">3D printing tips</a>.</p>
