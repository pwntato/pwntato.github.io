<h1>3D Printing Tips</h1>

<p>
I've learned a lot while working with my 3D printer and I wanted to share some of the more useful lessons.  Hopefully this will spare others some of the frustration I went through.  Unless otherwise specified, these apply to printing ABS with a consumer FDM 3D printer.

<strong>Prints warping and not sticking to the bed</strong><br/>
Turns out my print bed was getting oily from when I was touching it.  The fix was easy though, just wipe down the kapton tape on the bed with some acetone before each print.  Buy your acetone at the hardware store in the paint department, it is WAY cheaper than nail polish remover.

<strong>Extruder stops extruding and there is powdered ABS on the filament drive gear</strong><br/>
This one drove me crazy for a while, but it was caused by the printer trying to extrude plastic faster than it could get it to temprature.  Therefore there are two solutions: slow down the print speed, or turn up the extruder temperature.  Be careful not to raise the temperature higher than your machine can handle.  If you get close to the max it can handle, it's time to slow things down.

<strong>Stepper motors click, but don't move when you tell them to</strong><br/>
For me, this meant a bad power supply.  Test the voltage, if it is putting out less than the printer needs, then you need a new power supply.  My printer needs 12 volts and when this happened the power supply was only putting out 9 volts.  Replacing the power supply got me back up and running.
