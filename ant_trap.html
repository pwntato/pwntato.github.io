  <h1>Ant Trap</h1>
  <p>I have a 3 year old (Jimmy6), with a baby on the way, plus a cat (Spock) and a dog (Nibbler).  I also have an ant problem.</p>
  
  <p>If there are crumbs, the ants come.  If food isn't totally sealed, the ants come.  If food gets thrown away, the ants come.  If there's water in the shower, the ants come.</p>
  
  <p>Enough is enough, now it's war.</p>
  
  <p>I needed to find something that wouldn't poison my kids or pets.  Turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax" target="_blank">borax</a> will kill ants, but you have to trick them into eating it.  The cool thing about borax is that, while it's banned as a food additive in the US, it is added to food on purpose in China.  Not advocating eating it, just explaining why I am ok with having it around young children and pets.</p>
  
  <p>To trick the ants into eating the borax, you mix 1 part borax to 9 parts maple syrup.  I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Borax-Laundry-Booster-76-Box/dp/B000R4LONQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385857509&sr=8-1&keywords=borax" target="_blank">20 Mule Team Borax</a> and the cheapest syrup you can find.  It doesn't have to actually come from a tree.  When I first tried this, I ended up with a bowl of poison that I had to hide in a cabinet to keep the pets and kids away.  Not quite ideal.  That's why I designed a 3D printable dispenser.</p>

    <p>The trap is designed to be as spill resistant as possible.  Mostly so the cat can't knock it over.  He's always doing that.  It has a wide base, so it shouldn't tip.  If it does, it has a lip to try and limit the amount spilled.  Plus it is made to be held together tightly by zip ties.  The final protection is that this poison isn't very toxic to things bigger than ants.</p>
    
    <p>One thing to be careful about with 3D printed parts is that they might not be water tight.  Rather than relying on print settings to try to make sure it won't leak, I turned to nail polish.  I put on three coats of nail polish, following the directions on the bottle.  Then, to test it, I put in a couple drops of food coloring with some water and left it to sit on a paper towel for a few days.</p>

  <p>After it had gone several days without any color on the paper towel, I knew it was good to go.</p>
  
  <p>The recipe for poison is printed into the ant trap.  Put in borax to the first line, then fill to the second with maple syrup and stir.  It's that easy.</p>
  
  <p>If the parts fit together tightly and you aren't worried about little kids, the friction should be enough to keep pets out.  For kids though, I would recommend 2-4 zip ties to hold it shut for sure.</p>

  <p>These should be reusable, there is space specifically so the zip ties can be cut.  Then they can be rinsed out and new poison added.  Or you can toss them since they'll be sticky and full of dead ants.  I won't tell.</p>
  
  <p>To make one for yourself, clone my <a href="https://github.com/pwntato/ant_trap" target="_blank">github repo</a>.  You might want to play with the padding to get it just right for your printer, but it should work pretty easily as is.</p>
