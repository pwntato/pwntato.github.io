I wanted to try my hand at designing a trigger group, that turned into the Bandit MK1 Rubber Band Gun.  This gun is designed for 3D printing and should be a fairly easy, albeit time consuming, to print.  It is designed to use #10 rubber bands and it shoots them quite well.

The trigger group is based loosely off of the Colt 1911.
