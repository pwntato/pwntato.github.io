Hi!  I'm Jimmy Hendrix, welcome to my projects page!
</p>
<p>
I spend my days working on <a href="http://www.liveplan.com/" target="_blank">LivePlan.com</a>, making fantastic business planning software.  Then I split my free time between my awesome family and my side projects.  My early side projects were interesting bits of software, but now I focus on CAD for 3D printing.
</p>
<p>
I first discovered 3D printers at Siggraph in my late teens and dreamed of one day having my own.  That day finally came over a decade later when consumer 3D printers fell into my price range.
</p>
<p>
Then came the question: what now?
</p>
<p>
After some experimenting with different technologies, I found <a href="http://www.openscad.org/" target="_blank">OpenSCAD</a>.  I could leverage my programming skills to make real things!  That's just what I did.
</p>
<p>
From a lot of trial and error, I got familiar with the limitations of what consumer 3D printers are able to do well.  It became my goal to design neat things that would be easy to print reliably.  I launched this page to share those projects with you.
</p>
<p>
Take a look around and <a href="https://twitter.com/j5project" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a> for updates as I add more projects.

<p>
Thanks for stopping by!
